                <div>Hi there! I'm Moroni, a software developer by profession, but a drone enthusiast at heart. This website is my little corner on the internet where I share my passion for capturing the world from above with drone photography, and the thrill of FPV (First Person View) drone racing.</div>

                    <p><img src="images/home2.jpg" alt="Welcome">Ever since I laid my hands on my first drone, I was hooked. There's something magical about seeing the world from
                        a bird's eye view â€“ the landscapes, the horizons, and everything in between. It's like a different world up there,
                        and I aim to share that beauty with you through my collection of stunning aerial photographs.
                        <br/><br/>But that's not all! I'm also an avid FPV racer. There's a unique adrenaline rush that comes with piloting a drone
                        at high speeds, maneuvering through obstacles, and competing with fellow racers. It's a world full of excitement
                        and challenges, and I can't wait to bring you along for the ride.
                      <br/><br/>So, whether you're here to appreciate the beauty of drone photography, learn a few tips and tricks of the trade,
                        or simply share in the excitement of FPV racing, you're in the right place. Dive in, explore, and let's embark on
                        this exciting journey together! </p>
