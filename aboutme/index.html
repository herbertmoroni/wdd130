    <h2>Moroni</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>I am a happily married father of three beautiful girls. I hail from the south of Brazil, but now my family and I reside in Ogden, Utah. Professionally, I work for a nutraceutical company as a software developer. In my free time, I have a passion for flying racing drones.</p>
    <p>One of my core beliefs is the importance of continuous learning, which is why I'm currently studying at BYUI. I often liken studying to going to the gym: if you stop, it becomes hard to restart, and the initial stages can be quite challenging! Every year, I set a goal to learn something new. This year, I've set my sights on understanding the art of bonsai trees.</p>
